# Privileges

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges)

### Transparent, free, and secure admin rights management for macOS.

_Privileges_ is a free macOS application designed for modern enterprise environments. It gives users temporary administrator privileges when needed without granting permanent admin rights. The application is built with simplicity, security, and transparency in mind. Users can set a timeframe in the application's settings to perform specific tasks, such as installing or removing an application.

Using a standard user account instead of an administrator account adds an extra layer of security to your Mac and is considered a security best practice. We believe that all users, including developers, can benefit from using _Privileges_.

**_Privileges_ supports the following macOS versions:**

* macOS 26.x
* macOS 15.x
* macOS 14.x
* macOS 13.x (*)
* macOS 12.x
* macOS 11.x

<br/>

>[!NOTE]
>Unfortunately, macOS 13 incorrectly reports a launch constraint violation and immediately terminates the application. Starting with version 2.2, we are therefore providing two versions of the application: one with launch constraints and one without. However, we recommend using the version with launch constraints whenever possible.

# Security

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Local administrators on macOS have extensive capabilities to make changes to a Mac. This can include completely removing the _Privileges_ application. Therefore, _Privileges_ cannot guarantee that elevated permissions will be removed from the user account at all or on any specific schedule. _Privileges_ cannot undo other changes made by a user - or processes acting as the user - when that user has elevated rights. Organizations should consider this when designing their client management, device compliance, security hardening, and auditing policies.
