# Privileges

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges)

Privileges is an application for macOS which allows users to work as a standard user for day-to-day tasks, by providing a quick and easy way to request administrator rights. Users can set a timeframe in the application’s settings to perform specific tasks, such as installing or removing an application. To request admin rights, simply click on the Privileges icon in your Dock. 

Working as standard user instead of an administrator adds another layer of security to your Mac and is considered a security best practice. We believe all users, including all developers, can benefit from using Privileges.

**Privileges supports the following macOS versions:**

* macOS 15.x
* macOS 14.x
* macOS 13.x (*)
* macOS 12.x
* macOS 11.x

>[!NOTE]
>It seems that macOS 13 erroneously reports a launch constraint violation and terminates the appliction immediately. Therefore starting with version 2.2, we'll provide two different versions of the application. One with launch constraints and one whithout. Nevertheless, we recommend using the version with launch constraints whenever possible.
