 @method        authorizationRightForCommand:
 @abstract      For a given command selector, return the associated authorization right name.
 @param         command The command selector.
 @discussion    Returns a dictionary that represents everything we need to know about the
 authorized commands supported by the app.  Each dictionary key is the string form of
 the command selector.  The corresponding object is a dictionary that contains three items:

 @b kCommandKeyAuthRightName is the name of the authorization right itself.  This is used by
 both the app (when creating rights and when pre-authorizing rights) and by the tool
 (when doing the final authorization check).

 @b kCommandKeyAuthRightDefault is the default right specification, used by the app to when
 it needs to create the default right specification.  This is commonly a string contacting
 a rule a name, but it can potentially be more complex.  See the discussion of the
 rightDefinition parameter of AuthorizationRightSet.

 @b kCommandKeyAuthRightDesc is a user-visible description of the right.  This is used by the
 app when it needs to create the default right specification.  Actually, string is used
 to look up a localized version of the string in "Common.strings".
